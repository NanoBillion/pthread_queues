.Sh NAME
.Nm pq_create
.Nd create a pthread queue
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In pq.h
.Ft pq_status_t
.Fn pq_create "struct pq_queue **q" "struct pq_attr *attr"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pq_create
function creates a new queue. Upon success it stores
a queue handle in the memory pointed to by
.Fa q .
The
.Fa attr
argument points to a structure with the following members:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 10n -compact
.It Sy maxmsg
Number of messages queue can receive until full.
.It Sy msgsize
Maximum message size in bytes.
.It Sy order
Insert/remove order, see below.
.It Sy maxprio
For priority queues, the maximum allowed priority.
.El
.Pp
The order attribute is one of
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 10n -compact
.It Sy PQ_ATTR_FIFO
FIFO (first in, first out).
How everybody understands a queue to behave.
Message priorities are ignored but sent and received intact.
Insert and remove operations have complexity O(1).
.It Sy PQ_ATTR_PRIOQ
Priority queue.
Messages have a priority and are removed highest priority first.
If more than one message has the highest priority, the order is
unspecified.
Insert and remove operations have complexity O(log N).
.It Sy PQ_ATTR_PRIFO
Priority queue plus FIFO.
Messages have a priority and are removed highest priority first.
If more than one message has the highest priority, the order
is FIFO among those messages.
The insert operation has complexity O(N), remove O(1).
.It Sy PQ_ATTR_LIFO
LIFO (last in, first out).
How everybody understands a stack to behave.
Message priorities are ignored but sent and received intact.
Insert and remove operations have complexity O(1).
.El
.Pp
Message data are copied when sent and received.
Data may come from objects that go out of
scope or are deallocated after sending.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, the function returns zero.
Otherwise an error number is returned to indicate the error or
special condition.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn pq_create
function fails if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The argument
.Fa q
or the argument
.Fa attr
is NULL.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
Not enough memory.
.It Bq Er EAGAIN
The system temporarily lacks the resources to create
another condition variable.
